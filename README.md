# Resume-Creator-V1
Creating a tailored resume for a specific job based on a **questionnaire** and a pre-existing **job posting**. Utilizing one's educational background, work experience, and skills extracted from user data to facilitate the application process for different positions. Our goal is to automate resume-creation and provide users with a [Program](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1no8bt4Vl_ngE7u_FqTtYrcEvz9cRQZMV-iriTJQQ_Ic/edit?usp=sharing) that generates a customized resume by locating skills words prevalent through their answers and the information contained in a job posting.
# Instructions
1. Install a **zip** of the corresponding repository.
2. Run `final-program.py` using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
3. Enter your `name` into the terminal.
4. Fill out the questionnaire. Your data will be saved as `(your name)-data` within the source folder on your device.
5. Locate a **job posting** from [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/?aceid=&gclid=CjwKCAjw5remBhBiEiwAxL2M9-pnLuxL9aJPS8UisEOCIFVx20fqImSeTwzhiDEAoltwoHYOxmPq2RoCY1cQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) and copy its details into the terminal.
6. Type `ENDPOST` to indicate a complete job posting, and press `Enter`.
7. The final resume will be created as `resume-draft.docx`.
# Notes
Future updates to this program may include the following:
1. Implementing a simple UI and eliminating a terminal-based input.
2. Creating an open-source website for users to create resumes from directly.
3. Reformatting the resume based on a greater variety of type - stem, medical, service, etc.
4. Organizing the final resume into a user-based format - templates that are visually appealing as opposed to only a `.docx` file.
